---

## üéØ Quick Deploy Steps

### Part 1: Deploy Backend on Railway (5 minutes)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not done already):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend on Railway**:
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí Set **Root Directory** to `/backend`
   - Go to **Variables** ‚Üí Add:
     ```
     NODE_ENV=production
     CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-site.netlify.app
     ```
   - Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
   - **Copy your backend URL** (e.g., `https://backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

3. **Test Backend**:
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}`

---

### Part 2: Deploy Frontend on Netlify (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Netlify**:
   - Visit https://app.netlify.com
   - Sign up/Login with GitHub

2. **Create New Site**:
   - Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
   - Select your repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Base directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend/dist`

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Click "Show advanced" or go to Site settings after creation
   - Click "Add environment variables"
   - Add:
     ```
     Variable: VITE_API_URL
     Value: https://your-backend-url.railway.app
     ```
   - (Use your actual Railway backend URL from Part 1)

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for build
   - **Copy your Netlify URL** (e.g., `https://your-site.netlify.app`)

#### Option B: Netlify CLI

# - Publish directory: dist
```

---

### Part 3: Update Backend CORS (2 minutes)

1. **Go back to Railway Dashboard**
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Update `CORS_ORIGIN` with your actual Netlify URL:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-site.netlify.app
   ```
5. Backend will redeploy automatically (1-2 minutes)

---

### Part 4: Test Your Deployment ‚úÖ

1. **Visit Your Netlify Site**:
   - Go to `https://your-site.netlify.app`
   - Dashboard should load

2. **Test Functionality**:
   - Select "North Goa" ‚Üí Data should update
   - Select "South Goa" ‚Üí Data should update
   - Charts should display
   - Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí No errors in console

3. **Test on Mobile**:
   - Open on your phone
   - Should be responsive and work smoothly

## üîß Configuration Files Included

Your project already has these files configured:

### `frontend/netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.0.0"
  VITE_API_URL = "your-backend-url"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### `frontend/public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html    200
```

These files ensure:
- ‚úÖ SPA routing works correctly
- ‚úÖ Direct URL access works
- ‚úÖ No 404 errors on refresh

---

## üîë Environment Variables Reference

### Backend (Railway)
| Variable | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | `production` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Your Netlify URL | `https://your-site.netlify.app` |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Optional | `mongodb://...` |

### Frontend (Netlify)
| Variable | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Your Railway backend URL | `https://backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app` |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: 
- Include `https://` protocol
- NO trailing slash
- Must be exact URLs

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Page not found" on Netlify

**Symptoms**: 
- Homepage loads but other routes show 404
- Refresh on any page shows 404

**Solution**:
1. Check if `_redirects` file exists in `frontend/public/`
2. It should contain: `/*    /index.html    200`
3. Redeploy: `netlify deploy --prod` or trigger redeploy in dashboard

**Why**: React Router needs all routes to go to `index.html` for client-side routing.

---

### Issue: "Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"

**Symptoms**:
- Frontend loads but no data displays
- Console shows network errors
- API calls failing

**Solution**:
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Netlify:
   - Go to Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Check if `VITE_API_URL` exists
   - Verify it matches your Railway backend URL exactly
2. Check backend is running:
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should return `{"status":"healthy"}`
3. Rebuild frontend after setting env var:
   - Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Deploy site

**Why**: Vite builds environment variables into the bundle at build time.

---

### Issue: CORS Error

**Symptoms**:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://backend...' from origin 'https://your-site.netlify.app' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution**:
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Backend service ‚Üí Variables
2. Check `CORS_ORIGIN` value
3. It MUST match your Netlify URL exactly:
   - ‚úÖ `https://your-site.netlify.app`
   - ‚ùå `https://your-site.netlify.app/`
   - ‚ùå `your-site.netlify.app`
   - ‚ùå `http://your-site.netlify.app`
4. Save and wait for backend redeploy

---

### Issue: Build Fails on Netlify

**Common Errors**:

**Error: "Command failed with exit code 1"**
- Check build logs for specific error
- Common cause: Missing dependencies
- Fix: Ensure `package.json` has all dependencies

**Error: "VITE_API_URL is not defined"**
- Environment variable not set
- Fix: Add `VITE_API_URL` in Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
- Redeploy after adding

**Error: "Directory not found: dist"**
- Wrong publish directory
- Fix: Set to `frontend/dist` or just `dist` if base is `frontend`

---

### Issue: Blank/White Screen

**Symptoms**:
- Site deploys successfully
- But shows blank white page

**Solution**:
1. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
2. Check for errors
3. Common causes:
   - JavaScript errors (check console)
   - Missing environment variables
   - Wrong asset paths
4. Fix:
   - Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
   - Clear cache and redeploy
   - Check if `dist` folder has `index.html`

---

## üé® Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add Custom Domain to Netlify:

1. **Buy Domain** (from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)

2. **Add to Netlify**:
   - Site settings ‚Üí Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `mgnrega-goa.com`)

3. **Configure DNS**:
   - Add A record pointing to Netlify's load balancer:
     ```
     A @ 75.2.60.5
     ```
   - Or CNAME for subdomain:
     ```
     CNAME www your-site.netlify.app
     ```

4. **Update Backend CORS**:
   - Go to Railway ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Variables
   - Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to your custom domain:
     ```
     CORS_ORIGIN=https://mgnrega-goa.com
     ```

5. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Netlify automatically provisions SSL
   - Wait 24 hours for DNS propagation
   - Certificate will be issued automatically
