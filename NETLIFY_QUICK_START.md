2. Sign in with GitHub
3. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub repo
4. **IMPORTANT**: Settings ‚Üí Root Directory ‚Üí Set to `/backend`
5. Variables ‚Üí Add:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-site.netlify.app
   ```
6. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
7. **Copy backend URL** (e.g., `https://backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

---

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend on Netlify

     ```
   - (Use your actual Railway URL from Step 2!)

5. **Deploy Site**
   - Click "Deploy site"

   ```
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-actual-site.netlify.app
   ```
5. Backend redeploys automatically

---

### Step 5: Test Your Site ‚úÖ

1. **Visit Your Netlify URL**
   - Open `https://your-site.netlify.app`

## üêõ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Page not found" on Netlify

**Fix:**
- The `_redirects` file is already in `frontend/public/`

  - Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Clear cache and deploy site

---

### Issue: Blank/White Screen

**Fix:**
1. Check if `VITE_API_URL` is set:
   - Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Should show `VITE_API_URL=your-backend-url`
2. If missing, add it and redeploy
3. **IMPORTANT**: Must redeploy after adding env vars!

---

### Issue: CORS Error in Console

```
Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy
```

**Fix:**
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Backend service ‚Üí Variables
2. Check `CORS_ORIGIN` value
3. Must match Netlify URL EXACTLY:
   - ‚úÖ `https://your-site.netlify.app`
   - ‚ùå `https://your-site.netlify.app/` (no trailing slash)
   - ‚ùå `http://your-site.netlify.app` (must be https)
4. Save and wait for backend redeploy

---

### Issue: "Network Error" / No Data Loading

**Fix:**
1. Check backend is running:
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}`
2. If backend works, check frontend env var:
   - Netlify ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Verify `VITE_API_URL` matches backend URL exactly
3. Redeploy frontend after fixing

---

### Issue: Build Fails on Netlify

**Common errors:**

**"VITE_API_URL is not defined"**
- Add environment variable in Netlify
- Redeploy

**"Directory not found: dist"**
- Check publish directory is `frontend/dist`
- Or just `dist` if base directory is `frontend`

**"Command failed"**
- Check build logs for specific error
- Usually missing dependencies
- Push `package.json` to GitHub

## üîë Environment Variables Summary

### Backend (Railway):
```
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### Frontend (Netlify):
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Replace with your actual URLs!

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always deploy backend FIRST** so you have the URL for frontend
2. **Copy URLs immediately** after each deployment
3. **Use exact URLs** - include `https://`, no trailing slash
4. **Redeploy frontend** after adding environment variables
5. **Check deploy logs** if something fails

---

## üéØ Your Deployment URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

```
Frontend: https://your-site.netlify.app
Backend:  https://backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

Write these down! You'll need them.
