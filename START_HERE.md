1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. In Settings → Set **Root Directory**: `/backend`
6. In Variables → Add:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
   ```
7. Copy the backend URL

**B. Deploy Frontend:**
1. In same project → Click "New" → "GitHub Repo"
2. Select same repository
3. In Settings → Set **Root Directory**: `/frontend`

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Backend Needs:
```
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app
MONGODB_URI=optional (uses CSV fallback)
```

### Frontend Needs:
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

**Important**: Replace the URLs with your actual Railway URLs!

## ✅ Pre-Flight Check

Before deploying, ensure:
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Railway account created (free at railway.app)
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub

**Run this to verify everything:**
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ..
```

If no errors → You're ready! 🚀

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Backend returns 500 error"
**Fix**: Backend automatically uses CSV data. Check Railway logs for specifics.

### Issue: "Frontend shows Network Error"
**Fix**: Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend matches your backend URL exactly.

### Issue: "CORS Error"
**Fix**: Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend to match frontend URL exactly.

### Issue: "Build Failed"
**Fix**: 
- Ensure root directory is set correctly (`/backend` or `/frontend`)
- Check Railway logs for specific error
- Verify Node version is 18+

## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Backend:
1. Railway detects Node.js project
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Starts with `npm start` → `node src/server.js`
4. Loads CSV data from `src/data/goa_mgnrega.csv`
5. Exposes API endpoints on Railway's provided URL

### Frontend:
1. Railway detects Vite project
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Builds with `npm run build`
4. Serves with `npm run preview`
5. Connects to backend API
